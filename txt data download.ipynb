Business.\\n    Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing  Company was incorporated in 1929 under\\nthe laws of the State of Delaware  to continue operations, begun in 1902, of a\\nMinnesota corporation  of  the same  name.   As  used  herein, the  term  \"3M\"\\nincludes Minnesota Mining  and Manufacturing Company  and subsidiaries  unless\\nthe context otherwise indicates. 3M employs 86,168 persons.\\n\\n    3M is an integrated  enterprise characterized by substantial interdivision\\nand intersector  cooperation  in  research,  manufacturing  and  marketing  of\\nproducts  incorporating similar  component  materials  manufactured at  common\\ninternal sources.  Its business has developed from its research and technology\\nin coating  and bonding for  coated abrasives, its  only product in  its early\\nyears. Coating and bonding is the process of applying one material to another,\\nsuch as adhesives to  a backing (pressure-sensitive tapes),  abrasive granules\\nto  paper or  cloth (coated  abrasives), ceramic  coating to  granular mineral\\n(roofing granules), heat-  or light-  sensitive materials to  paper, film  and\\nmetal  (dry silver  paper, photographic  film and  lithographic  plates), iron\\noxide to plastic  backing (magnetic  recording tape), glass  beads to  plastic\\nbacking (reflective sheeting), and low tack adhesives to paper (repositionable\\nnotes).\\n\\n    3M believes that it  is among the leading  producers of products  for many\\nof the markets it serves. In all  cases, 3M products are subject to direct  or\\nindirect competition.  Generally speaking, most 3M  products involve technical\\ncompetence  in development,  manufacturing and  marketing  and are  subject to\\ncompetition with products manufactured and sold by other  technically-oriented\\ncompanies.\\n\\n    3M\\'s three  business sectors  are: Industrial  and Consumer;  Information,\\nImaging and Electronic; and Life Sciences.  Each sector brings together common\\nor  related  3M technologies  and thus  provides  greater opportunity  for the\\nfuture development of  products and services and  a more efficient  sharing of\\nbusiness strengths.\\n\\n    The notes  to the financial statements on page 25 and 26 of this Form 10-K\\nprovide financial information concerning 3M\\'s three industry segments and 3M\\'s\\noperations in various geographic areas of the world.\\n\\nIndustry Segments\\n\\n    3M\\'s  operations are organized  into three business sectors. These sectors\\nhave worldwide  responsibility for  virtually all  3M  product lines.   A  few\\nmiscellaneous  and staff-sponsored new products, still in development, are not\\nassigned to the sectors.\\n\\n    Industrial and Consumer  Sector:   This sector is  a leader in  developing\\nthe technologies for pressure-sensitive adhesives, specialty tapes, coated and\\nnonwoven abrasives,  and specialty chemicals.

The remaining\\n223 sales offices and distribution centers are located in 52 countries outside\\nthe United States.\\n\\nResearch, Patents and Raw Materials\\n\\n    Research and  product  development constitute  an important  part of  3M\\'s\\nactivities, and products resulting from such research and product  development\\nhave contributed  in large measure to its growth.   The total amount spent for\\nall research  and development activities  was $1.030 billion,  $1.007 billion,\\nand $914 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.\\n\\n    The corporate research  laboratories are  engaged in  research which  does\\nnot relate directly  to 3M\\'s existing  product lines.   They also support  the\\nresearch efforts  of division  and sector  laboratories. Most  major operating\\ndivisions  and  domestic  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  several   international\\nsubsidiaries, have their own laboratories for improvement of existing products\\nand  development of related new  products.  Engineering  research staff groups\\nprovide  specialized  services  in instrumentation,  engineering  and  process\\ndevelopment.  An organization is maintained  for technological development not\\nsponsored by other units of the company.\\n\\n    3M  is the owner  of many domestic  and foreign  patents derived primarily\\nfrom its own research activities.  3M does not consider that its business as a\\nwhole is  materially dependent upon any one patent, license or trade secret or\\nany group of related patents, licenses or trade secrets.\\n\\n    The  company  experienced  no  significant  or  unusual  problems  in  the\\npurchase  of raw  materials during 1993.   While  3M has  successfully met its\\ndemands to date, it is impossible to predict future shortages or their impact.\\n\\n\\n\\nExecutive Officers\\n\\n    The following  is a list of  the executive officers of  3M as  of March 1,\\n1994, their present  position, their  current age, the  year first elected  to\\ntheir position  and other positions  held within  3M during the  previous five\\nyears. All of these persons have been employed full time by 3M or a subsidiary\\nof 3M for  more than five  years.  All  officers are elected  by the Board  of\\nDirectors at its annual meeting, with vacancies and new positions being filled\\nat  interim meetings.

Management believes 3M\\'s existing physical facilities are highly\\nsuitable for the purposes for which they were designed.\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\\n\\n    The company  and certain  of its subsidiaries  are named  defendants in  a\\nnumber of  actions, governmental  proceedings  and claims,  including  product\\nliability claims involving products  now or formerly manufactured and  sold by\\nthe company, many of which  relate to silicone gel mammary implants,  and some\\nof which claims are purported or tentatively certified class actions.  Mammary\\nimplant cases and claims are discussed separately below.  In some actions, the\\nclaimants  seek  damages as  well  as other  relief which,  if  granted, would\\nrequire substantial expenditures.\\n\\n    The company  is  involved in  a  number  of environmental  proceedings  by\\ngovernmental agencies asserting  liability for past  waste disposal and  other\\nalleged environmental damage.   The company  conducts ongoing  investigations,\\nassisted by environmental consultants, to determine accruals for the probable,\\nestimable  costs of remediation.   The remediation accruals  are reviewed each\\nquarter and changes are made as appropriate.\\n\\n    Some of  these  matters raise  difficult  and  complex factual  and  legal\\nissues and are subject  to many uncertainties, including, but not  limited to,\\nthe  facts and circumstances of  each particular action,  the jurisdiction and\\nforum in which  each action is proceeding, and  differences in applicable law.\\nAccordingly, the company is not able to  estimate the nature and amount of any\\nfuture liability with respect to such matters.\\n\\nMammary Implant Litigation\\n\\n    As of December 31, 1993, the company had been named as a defendant,  often\\nwith multiple co-defendants, in  3,054 claims and lawsuits in  various courts,\\nall  seeking damages  for personal  injuries from  allegedly defective  breast\\nimplants.   These  claims and  lawsuits, including  class actions,  purport to\\nrepresent 8,842 individual claimants.  These claims and lawsuits are generally\\nin  very preliminary  stages, and  it is  not yet  certain how  many  of these\\nlawsuits and  claims involve products manufactured and sold by the company, as\\nopposed to other  manufacturers.  The company entered the  business in 1977 by\\npurchasing McGhan  Medical and subsequently sold  that business in 1984.   The\\ncompany\\'s sales of implants, during the time that it engaged in this business,\\nrepresent approximately  seven percent of the total cumulative mammary implant\\nsales.   The  company  is  vigorously  defending  the  individual  claims  and\\nlawsuits.  Given the  preliminary state of the proceedings,  company\\'s counsel\\nhas not yet reached a conclusion on the probability of company liability.\\n\\n    Discussions  regarding a  possible  \"global  settlement\" have  taken place\\nduring the  last several months, with  the facilitation of a  panel of federal\\njudges acting as mediators, between a plaintiffs\\'  steering committee, various\\nplaintiff  groups,  the mediators,  and key  defendants.   The  company  was a\\nparticipant in  these mediation efforts.   On February 14, 1994,  Dow Corning,\\nBristol-Myers Squibb, and Baxter Healthcare Corp., together with several other\\ndefendants, announced  an agreement with representatives  from the plaintiffs\\'\\nsteering  committee on financial terms  for a global  settlement.  The company\\nwas not  included by the  parties in  this arrangement.   Discussions are  now\\nbeing conducted  between the  company and  representatives of the  plaintiffs\\'\\nsteering committee.   The  company does  not know at  this time  whether these\\ndiscussions will  lead to resolution  of all or any  portion of the  suits and\\nclaims against it or whether it will be a participant in such a settlement.\\n\\n    With respect  to these silicone gel  mammary implant  claims and lawsuits,\\nthe company\\'s general counsel has opined that, based solely on the facts known\\nas  of  February  25,  1994,  date  of  the  opinion  and  subject  to  future\\ndevelopments,  there is sufficient insurance coverage to recover all liability\\nand costs arising  out of these  matters.  No  insurers have denied  coverage.\\nTherefore,  the company  believes that such  matters will not  pose a material\\nrisk to the financial position of the company or its results of operations.\\n\\n<PAGE>\\nItem 4.

Management\\'s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial  Condition  and\\nResults of Operations.\\n\\n  Operating Results\\n1993 was a challenging year in several respects.  The company faced recessions\\nin Europe and Japan, negative currency effects, a soft U.S. health care market\\nand a highly competitive pricing environment.\\n   Worldwide net  sales rose  1.0 percent to  $14.020 billion.   This followed\\nincreases of 4.1 percent in 1992 and 2.5 percent in 1991.\\n   Sales in  the United States were  $7.126 billion, up  about 3 percent  from\\n1992.  Internationally, sales  totaled $6.894 billion,  a decrease of about  1\\npercent from 1992.\\n   Estimatedcomponents ofsales changefrom prioryears wereasfollows (percents):\\n\\n                              1993                          1992\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n                        U.S.  Int\\'l Worldwide         U.S.  Int\\'l Worldwide\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nVolume                   5      7       6              3      5       4\\nPrice                   (2)    (2)     (2)            ---    (1)     (1) \\nTranslation             ---    (6)     (3)            ---     1       1\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n  Total                  3     (1)      1              3      5       4\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n   In the United States volume  growth accelerated in 1993, helped by a slight\\nimprovement  in   the  domestic  economy;  however,   pricing  pressures  also\\nincreased, mainly in memory technologies product lines.\\n   Internationally,  sales growth in local currencies was slightly better than\\nin 1992.  However,  currency fluctuations, which added to  international sales\\nin 1992, reduced those sales by about 6 percent in 1993.\\n   Cost of goods sold was 60.8 percent of sales, up from 60.1 percent in 1992.\\nThe negative impact of lower selling prices and currency was partially  offset\\nby improvements  due to productivity gains  and lower raw material  costs.  In\\n1992, cost of goods sold  decreased as a percent of sales compared to 1991 due\\nto productivity gains and lower raw material costs which were partially offset\\nby higher R&D spending and lower selling prices.  Cost of goods  sold includes\\nmanufacturing, research and development, and engineering expenses.\\n   Selling, general and  administrative expenses decreased to  25.2 percent of\\nsales as the  result of several cost-reduction  programs.  This  compares with\\n25.6  percent in  1992  and 24.9  percent  in  1991.   The  1992 increase  was\\nmagnified  by costs for voluntary  separations, higher sales  costs and modest\\nvolume growth.\\n   Worldwide employment decreased by over 1,000 in 1993, even though about 600\\npeople were added to  support continued rapid growth in  developing countries.\\nThis  net reduction  in  employment occurred  with  little disruption  to  the\\ncompany.\\n\\n(Percent of sales)                                1993        1992        1991\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nCost of goods sold                                60.8        60.1        60.4\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses      25.2        25.6        24.9\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n In December  1992, 3M  recognized  $129 million  in  settlement of  a  patent\\nlawsuit involving 3M orthopedic  casting materials.  Operating income  in 1992\\nincludes  this  amount, which  is  shown  on a  separate  line  of the  Income\\nStatement titled \"legal settlement.\"\\n Also in 1992,  3M recorded  $115 million of  special charges  to enhance  its\\ncompetitiveness and  productivity.   These charges  relate primarily to  asset\\nwrite-downs, including rationalization of manufacturing operations.  Operating\\nincome  in 1992  includes this  amount, which  is shown  on a  separate Income\\nStatement line titled \"special charges\".\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n Worldwide operating income in  1993 decreased 1.9 percent to  $1.956 billion.\\nThe positive impact  of increased sales volume and cost  control was more than\\noffset by negative  currency and pricing.   Operating income in  1993 included\\nabout   $53   million  for   manufacturing   rationalizations   and  voluntary\\nseparations.  This  compared to 1992 costs of about  $80 million for voluntary\\nseparation programs, in addition to the $115 million of special charges.    In\\n1992, operating income  increased 1.7  percent, following a  decrease of  10.6\\npercent in 1991.\\n\\n(Percent of sales)                                1993        1992        1991\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nOperating Income                                  14.0        14.4        14.7\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n Interest expense  was $50  million, down  from $76  million in  1992 and  $97\\nmillion in 1991.   The declines in both 1993 and 1992 were mainly due to lower\\ninterest rates.   Investment and  other income  totaled $96  million in  1993,\\nwhich includes a $36 million benefit from tax settlements, improved investment\\nresults, and other items, many of which  were of a non-recurring nature.  This\\ncompared  with investment  and other  income of  $29 million  in 1992  and $15\\nmillion in 1991.\\n The company\\'s  effective tax  rate was  35.3 percent  of pre-tax income,  the\\nsame as in 1992 and down from 36.8 percent in 1991.  The 1 percent increase in\\nthe 1993  U.S. statutory corporate  tax rate was offset  by lower taxes  on 3M\\nInternational Operations,  the extension of  the U.S. R&D  tax credit and  the\\npositive effect of  revaluing deferred tax assets.  The company\\'s deferred tax\\nassets will reverse over an extended period of time.\\n  Net income increased 2.5 percent to $1.263 billion, or $5.82 per share.   In\\n1992, net income increased 6.8 percent to $1.233 billion, or  $5.63 per share,\\ncompared with $1.154 billion, or $5.26 per share, in 1991.\\n      The  company estimates  that changes  in the  value  of the  U.S. dollar\\ndecreased  1993  net income  by  about $62  million,  or 29  cents  per share.\\nCurrency  changes increased  net income  by about  $1 million,  or 1  cent per\\nshare, in  1992, and by $23  million, or 11 cents  per share, in  1991.  These\\nestimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into\\nU.S.  dollars, the costs in local currencies of transferring goods between the\\nparent  company in the U.S. and international companies, and transaction gains\\nand losses in countries not considered to be highly inflationary.\\n Over  the  long term,  3M  expects to  meet its  aggressive  financial goals.\\nThese include a growth  in earnings per share  averaging 10 percent a  year or\\nbetter; return on stockholders\\' equity of 20 to 25 percent;  return on capital\\nemployed  of 27  percent or  better;  and 30  percent of  sales from  products\\nintroduced in the last four years.\\n Earnings per share  increased 3.4 percent in 1993.   Currency effects reduced\\nearnings by about 5 percent.   Return on average stockholders\\' equity was 19.1\\npercent, up from 18.8 percent in 1992.  This return has averaged  20.5 percent\\nover the past 5 years.  Return on capital employed was 19.1 percent, down from\\n19.7 percent  in 1992.  This return has averaged  22.1 percent over the past 5\\nyears.     In 1993 more than 25 percent of sales came from products introduced\\nwithin the last 4 years.\\n\\n  Performance by Business Sector\\nIndustrial and Consumer Sector:\\nIn 1993, sales were up 2.6 percent to $5.4 billion.  Operating income rose 2.8\\npercent to  $849 million.  Excluding  special charges of $13  million in 1992,\\noperating income  rose 1.2 percent in  1993.  Sales and  profits showed strong\\ngrowth in the Asia  Pacific area and  in Latin America.   However, results  in\\nEurope were adversely affected by weak economies and the stronger U.S. dollar.\\nThis sector expects continued growth in  the United States, Asia Pacific  area\\nand in Latin America.\\n\\nInformation, Imaging and Electronic Sector:\\nIn  1993, sales were  down 1.7 percent to  $4.5 billion.   A solid increase in\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nunit volume was more than  offset by continued price competition  and negative\\ncurrency  translation.   Operating  income  increased  14.0  percent  to  $271\\nmillion.  Excluding  special charges of $81 million in  1992, operating income\\ndecreased  15.0  percent.   Operating profit  margins  were affected  by price\\ncompetition and  currency effects,  as  well as  by large  investments in  new\\nproducts and efforts to  streamline operations.  This sector  will continue to\\nface significant price pressure in 1994.\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nLife Sciences Sector:\\nIn  1993, sales  increased 2.6  percent  to $4.1  billion.   Sales growth  was\\nconstrained by the stronger U.S. dollar and by the slowdown in the U.S. health\\ncare  market due to  uncertainty over  health care  reform.   Operating income\\ndecreased  8.6 percent  to $846  million.   Excluding  a net  benefit of  $108\\nmillion  from  a  legal  settlement  and  special  charges,  operating  income\\nincreased by 3.4  percent.  This sector  will continue to  be impacted by  the\\nuncertainty over U.S. health care reform.\\n\\n  Financial Position\\n3M\\'s financial condition remained strong in 1993, despite a sluggish worldwide\\neconomy.  Balance sheet amounts did not vary significantly from 1992.  Various\\nitems, such as  cash and  short-term debt, can  fluctuate significantly   from\\nmonth to month depending on short-term  liquidity needs.  Substantially all of\\nthe vested and earned benefits under 3M\\'s employee retirement plans, and about\\nhalf  of the  other  postretirement benefit  obligations,  were funded  as  of\\nDecember 31, 1993.\\n  The company\\'s key  inventory index, which represents the number of months of\\ninventory, was  4.0 months, up from  3.8 months in 1992.   Accounts receivable\\ndays\\' sales outstanding  were 66 days, up  one day from  1992.  The  company\\'s\\ncurrent ratio was 1.9, unchanged from the end of 1992.\\n  Of the long-term debt  outstanding at the  end of 1993,  $469 million was  a\\nguarantee of debt of the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan.  Total debt  was 23\\npercent  of stockholders\\' equity  at the end  of 1993.   This compared with 22\\npercent at year-end 1992.  The  company\\'s borrowings continued to maintain AAA\\nlong-term ratings.\\n  Legal proceedings,  including the silicone gel  mammory prosthesis situation\\nand environmental liabilities, are discussed in the legal proceedings  section\\non page 8.  The  company believes that such  matters will not pose a  material\\nrisk to the financial position of the company.\\n\\n  Liquidity\\nDue  to a  change in  the  financial reporting  period for  3M\\'s international\\ncompanies, the 1992  Consolidated Statement  of Cash Flows  includes the  cash\\nprovided  or  used  by 3M\\'s  international  companies  for  a 14-month  period\\n(November 1, 1991, to December 31, 1992).\\n The  following  table  is presented  on  a  comparative  basis, whereby  1992\\nexcludes the November  1 to December  31, 1991, period  for our  international\\ncompanies.\\n\\n(Millions)                          1993         1992        1991 \\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nNet cash provided by\\n operating activities             $2,091       $2,218      $1,909 \\nNet cash used in \\n investing activities             (1,092)      (1,139)     (1,197)\\nNet cash used in\\n financing activities             (1,128)      (1,027)       (686)\\nEffect of exchange rate\\n changes on cash                      21          (20)        (62)\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nNet increase (decrease) in\\n cash and cash equivalents        $ (108)     $    32     $   (36)\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nCapital expenditures              $1,112       $1,225      $1,326 \\nDepreciation                         976          950         884 \\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nThe  company met  its cash requirements  primarily from  operating activities.\\nDuring  1993,  cash  flows provided  by  operating  activities  totaled $2.091\\nbillion.  This more than covered capital expenditures and dividend payments of\\n$1.833 billion.  The company\\'s superior credit rating  provides easy and ample\\naccess to global capital markets.\\n  As part of  our efforts  to control overall  spending, capital  expenditures\\ndeclined  9.3 percent to $1.112  billion in 1993.   This followed a decline of\\n7.5 percent in calendar year 1992.\\n Stockholder  dividends  increased 3.8  percent to  $3.32  per share  in 1993.\\nCash dividend payments  totaled $721 million.   3M has  paid dividends for  78\\nconsecutive years.  On February 14, 1994 the 3M Board of Directors boosted the\\nquarterly dividend on 3M  common stock 6 percent to 88 cents a share, declared\\na  two-for-one stock  split to shareholders  of record  on March  15, 1994 and\\nauthorized the  repurchase of up  to 12  million of the  company\\'s (pre-split)\\nshares.  This  share-repurchase authorization runs through February  10, 1995.\\nThe  company  repurchased all  of  the six  million  shares available  under a\\nprevious authorization. \\n Repurchases of 3M  common stock totaled $706  million in 1993,  compared with\\n$247 million in 1992 and $240 million in 1991.  Increased share repurchases in\\n1993 reduced  the total number of  shares outstanding by more  than 4 million.\\nRepurchases  were made to support employee  stock purchase plans and for other\\ncorporate purposes.  \\n\\n  Future Outlook\\nMost  economists expect slightly better global economic growth this year, with\\nthe improvement  coming  in the  second half.   This  combined with  continued\\nemphasis on productivity improvement and new products should help our results;\\nhowever, the pricing  environment is  likely to remain  quite competitive  and\\ncurrency fluctuations could have a significant, negative effect on our results\\nagain this year.\\n Spending on research  and development and  capital equipment  is expected  to\\nremain  around  1993 levels.   Employment  levels  should continue  to decline\\nslightly in 1994.\\n In 1992, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement  No. 112,\\n\"Employers\\' Accounting  for Postemployment Benefits.\"  Postemployment benefits\\ninclude,  but  are  not limited  to,  disability,  severance  and health  care\\nbenefits.   3M will adopt  this standard in  the first quarter of  1994.  This\\nadoption will have a diminimus effect on the company\\'s results of operations.\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 8.

These  securities\\n  are employed in the  company\\'s banking, captive insurance and  cash management\\n  operations.  The securities are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\\n\\n  Inventories:  Inventories are stated  at lower of cost or market,  with cost\\ngenerally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\\n\\n  Investments:  Investments  primarily include assets  from captive  insurance\\nand  banking   operations  and  from  venture  capital   investments.    These\\ninvestments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\\n\\n  Other Assets:   Other assets include  goodwill, patents, other  intangibles,\\ndeferred taxes and  other noncurrent  assets.  Other  assets are  periodically\\nreviewed  for  impairment  to  ensure  that  they  are  appropriately  valued.\\nGoodwill is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years.  Other\\nintangible items are amortized  on a straight-line basis over  their estimated\\neconomic lives.\\n\\n  Deferred  Income Taxes:   Deferred  income taxes  arise from  differences in\\nbasis for tax and financial-reporting purposes.\\n\\n  Revenue  Recognition:   Revenue  is recognized  upon  shipment of  goods  to\\ncustomers and upon performance of services.\\n\\n  Depreciation:   Depreciation of property,  plant and equipment  is generally\\ncomputed on  a straight-line basis  over the  estimated useful lives  of these\\nassets.\\n\\n  Research and Development:   Research  and development costs  are charged  to\\noperations as incurred and totaled $1.030  billion in 1993, $1.007 billion  in\\n1992 and $914 million in 1991.\\n\\n  Foreign Currency Translation:  Local currencies are generally considered the\\nfunctional  currencies outside  the United  States, except  in countries  with\\nhighly inflationary economies.  Assets and liabilities are translated at year-\\nend exchange rates for  operations in local currency environments.  Income and\\nexpense  items are translated at  average rates of  exchange prevailing during\\nthe   year.    Translation  adjustments   are  recorded  as   a  component  of\\nstockholders\\' equity.\\n   For  operations in  countries with  highly inflationary  economies, certain\\nfinancial  statement amounts are translated at historical exchange rates, with\\nall other assets and liabilities translated at year-end exchange rates.  These\\ntranslation  adjustments are  reflected in  the results  of operations.   They\\ndecreased  net income  by $12  million in  1993, increased  net income  by $10\\nmillion in 1992 and decreased net income by $6 million in 1991.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      24\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n  Accounting Changes\\nEffective  January  1,  1992,  3M\\'s  international  companies  changed   their\\nreporting  period from  a fiscal  year ending  October 31  to a  calendar year\\nending  December 31.  The change was  made to aid worldwide business planning,\\nincrease efficiency and reflect  the global nature of the  company\\'s business.\\nThe international companies\\' results  of operations for the period  November 1\\nto  December 31, 1991, are shown in  the 1992 Consolidated Statement of Income\\nas  a cumulative  effect  of an  accounting change.    The cash  flows  of the\\ninternational  companies for the 14-month period November 1, 1991, to December\\n31, 1992, are reflected in the 1992 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\\n  Effective  January  1,  1992,  the company  adopted  Statement  of Financial\\nAccounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postretirement\\nBenefits  Other Than  Pensions.\"   This statement  requires that  the  cost of\\nproviding postretirement  benefits  be  accrued  over  an  employee\\'s  service\\nperiod.  In implementing this standard, the company was required to accrue the\\nunfunded  obligation.  The company had accrued  and funded - under a different\\nactuarial methodology - a substantial amount of these benefits since 1977.  In\\nimplementing this  standard,  the company  elected  to record  the  transition\\nobligation using the immediate recognition option.\\n  Also   effective  January  1,  1992,  the  company  adopted  SFAS  No.  109,\\n\"Accounting for Income Taxes.\"  This statement requires an asset and liability\\napproach for financial  accounting and reporting of income  taxes.  Under this\\napproach, deferred  taxes are recognized  for the  estimated taxes  ultimately\\npayable or recoverable based on enacted tax law.  Changes in enacted tax rates\\nwill be reflected in the tax provision as they occur.\\n  Adoption of these accounting changes, in aggregate, did  not have a material\\nimpact on 1992 results of operations.  \\n  The  table below shows the components of the cumulative effect of accounting\\nchanges.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n(Millions, except per-share data)                                       1992\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n                                               Amount                Per Share\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nCumulative effect of change in:\\nReporting period for international\\n companies, net of $25 million in\\n taxes (including tax benefits from\\n revaluation of certain fixed assets\\n in Italy)                                      $ 100                 $ 0.46 \\nAccounting for other\\n postretirement benefits, net of\\n $107 million in taxes                           (183)                (0.84)\\nAccounting for income taxes                        80                  0.36\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n Total                                         $   (3)               $(0.02)\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n  Legal Settlement and Special Charges\\nIn  December 1992,  Johnson  &  Johnson  agreed  to pay  3M  $129  million  in\\nsettlement of  a patent lawsuit involving 3M orthopedic casting materials.  3M\\nreceived payment in January 1993.\\n\\nIn 1992,  3M  recorded $115  million of  special charges  designed to  enhance\\ncompetitiveness and productivity.
